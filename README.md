1. Share the URL reporting this data breach. [1 mark]
2. Briefly describe the impact of this data breach. Briefly describe how many users were affected, the level of impact (explaining whether it was low, medium, or high), and financial, or other losses (e.g., reputation damage). [5 marks]

Question II. (25 marks) Vulnerability Analysis. Visit https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html and search for a CVE ID (CVE, 2023) that contains the last three digits in your UPI (username). If no entry corresponds to the last three digits of your UPI (username), you can increment your UPI by one and repeat the process unless you find a valid CVE ID. If you see multiple CVE IDs, you can choose any one of them.

6. Can this vulnerability be identified using static analysis or dynamic analysis? Explain briefly. [5 marks]
Question III. (8 marks) Usable Security. As healthcare digitization continues, the industry must prioritize security measures that protect patient data, healthcare systems and infrastructure. Phishing is a leading cause of healthcare data breaches, and attacks have been increasing exponentially. Assume you are working as a cyber security consultant for the healthcare industry.
